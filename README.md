Pick and solve one (1) problem from the set { 2.18, 2.26, 2.27 } pages 52-54, using Python or another programming language.  
2.18 selected
  
M03 Hands-on & Drills  
Pick and solve any one (1) problem from the set {3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.10, 3.11, 3.13}, pages 79-80.  
3.10 selected
  
M04 Hands-on & Drills  
Solve any two (2) even-numbered (4.2, 4.4, 4.6, etc.) questions from chapter 4 (pages 108-109). And then analyze the results.  
4.4 & 4.6 selected
  
M05 Hands-on & Drills  
Solve any one (1) question from the set {5.3, 5.4, 5.6, 5.15, 5.16} from Chapter 5 (pages 142-144). And then analyze the results by contrasting the efficiency and/or convergence/divergence of the methods involved.  
5.3 selected  
  
M06 Hands-on & Drills  
For each of the following polynomials:  
    Apply either the Muller's method or the Bairstow's method to find all real or complex roots,  
    Analyze and contrast performance between the two methods,  
    Plot the functions to choose root guesses appropriately.  
    You can apply any simplifications you deem appropriate prior to applying the numerical methods.  
1. f(x) = x^3 - x^2 + 2x - 2  
2. f(x) = 2x^4 + 6x^2 + 8  
3. f(x) = -2 + 6.2x - 4x^2 + 0.7x^3  
4. f(x) = x^4 - 2x^3 + 6x^2 - 2x + 5  
  
Project
